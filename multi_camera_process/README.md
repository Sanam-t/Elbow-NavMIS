# Multi Camera Pipeline
The online and offline reconstruction and calibration processes are hosted in this folder as follows:
- **calibration.ipynb** A notebook that implements the multi-camera calibration procedure as explained [here](/doc/tutorial1_multi_3d.md).
- **reconstruction.ipynb** A notebook that uses the outputs of the calibration stage and reconstructs the 3D locations of the markers as explained [here](/doc/tutorial1_multi_3d.md).
